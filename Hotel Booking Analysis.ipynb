We explored the data using a variety of statistical and graphical techniques. We found that there is a positive relationship between the number of adults and the number of days in waiting list, and a negative relationship between the number of babies and the number of days in waiting list. This suggests that the number of adults in a booking is a more important factor in predicting the number of days in waiting list than the number of babies. Based on the findings from the EDA, we would suggest the client to focus on increasing the number of adults in their bookings. This is likely to lead to a decrease in the number of days in waiting list.\n","We also found that the most preferred hotel is Hotel A, followed by Hotel B and Hotel C. We also found that the average number of days in waiting list is higher for city hotels than for resort hotels. This suggests that city hotels are more popular than resort hotels.\n","In addition, we found that the average number of days in waiting list is higher for hotels with a higher price range. This suggests that hotels with a higher price range are more popular than hotels with a lower price range.\n","Overall, the EDA results provide valuable insights into the hotel booking data.

It is a matrix of values, where each cell represents the correlation between two variables. The values are typically represented by colors, with darker colors indicating stronger correlations and lighter colors indicating weaker correlations.\n","The correlation heatmap can be used to identify relationships between variables that may not be obvious from the data itself. For example, the heatmap below shows the correlation between the different features of a house. The darker colors indicate that there is a strong correlation between the features, while the lighter colors indicate that there is no correlation or a weak correlation.\n","The correlation heatmap can also be used to identify outliers. An outlier is a data point that is significantly different from the rest of the data. Outliers can be identified by looking for data points that are not in the same color range as the rest of the data.\n","The correlation heatmap is a powerful tool that can be used to gain insights into the relationship between different variables.
